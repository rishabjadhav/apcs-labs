# apcs-projects
This repository contains my projects from AP Computer Science during the 2020-2021 school year. In AP Computer Science, I learned how to use objects, arrays, ArrayLists, 2D Arrays, inheritance, and recursion. This was my second year coding in Java, and AP Computer Science helped me take my ability to code to the next level.
